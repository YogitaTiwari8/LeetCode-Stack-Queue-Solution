# 📚 Stack and Queue – Leetcode Practice

This repository contains Java solutions for important Stack and Queue problems from platforms like Leetcode and GeeksforGeeks. The code is clean, well-commented, and optimized for interviews and coding practice.

## 🔁 Stack

Stacks follow a **Last In First Out (LIFO)** order. Common use cases include:
- Validating expressions (e.g., balanced parentheses)
- Backtracking problems
- Monotonic stack problems (e.g., Next Greater Element, Stock Span)

### Key Concepts:
- Use `Stack<Integer>` or `Deque<Integer>` (`ArrayDeque`) for better performance.
- Monotonic stacks help efficiently track increasing or decreasing sequences.

## 📥 Queue

Queues follow a **First In First Out (FIFO)** order. They are essential in:
- BFS traversal
- Sliding window problems
- Task scheduling, and real-time processing

### Key Concepts:
- Use `Queue<Integer>` or `Deque<Integer>` for efficient operations.
- Double-ended queues (Deques) help implement sliding window or maximum/minimum tracking in O(n) time.
